0.4.0 (unreleased)
====================

- Removed deprecated `coverage_source` config option (use `source_dirs` instead).
- Positional argument is now a test selector only — does not affect `test_dir` or `source_dirs`.
- Ad-hoc mode: without `pyproject.toml`, defaults to `test_dir=.` and `source_dirs=["."]`.
- When cwd is `tests/`, automatically finds `pyproject.toml` in parent directory.
- `source_dirs` validation is now lazy — errors only with `--cov` or `--changed`.
- Smart `sys.path` setup: walks up from cwd through `__init__.py` to find package root.
- Display resolved `test_dir` and `source_dirs` on startup.
- Support Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Improved error output (color, traceback, diff).
- Dot-mode progress by default, `-v` for full test names.
- Added `--debug` flag (dependency graph, changed modules). `-v` no longer shows debug info.


0.3.0 (2026-02-03)
====================

- Topological test ordering by import dependencies (dependencies run first).
- Added `--alpha` / `-a` flag to use alphabetical ordering instead.
- Added `--changed` / `-c` flag for incremental testing (only run tests affected by changes).
- Added `--dry-run` flag to list tests without running them.
- Added `--verbose` / `-v` flag.
- Added `--version` / `-V` flag.
- Colorized test output using `rich`.
- Logging output is now captured along with stdout/stderr.
- Renamed `coverage_source` config to `source_dirs` (`coverage_source` still works but is deprecated).
- Added Claude Code plugin for AI-assisted testing.

0.2.1 (2025-07-06)
====================

- Fix: Add README to PyPI package description.

0.2.0 (2025-07-06)
====================

- Project revived, requires Python 3.12+ (3.13 supported)
- Test discovery and filtering by keyword (`-k`)
- Exit on first failure (`-x`)
- Disable output capturing (`-s`)
- Code coverage (`--cov`)
- Sort tests by their definition order
- Async test validation
- Warning collection and reporting
- Improved CLI with proper exit codes and conditional `ipdb` support
- Set `TEST_RUNNER=rut` environment variable
- Coverage source is now configurable via `pyproject.toml` and defaults to `["src", "tests"]`
- Warning filters are now configurable via `pyproject.toml`
- Session-level setup and teardown hooks (`rut_session_setup`, `rut_session_teardown`) in `conftest.py`
