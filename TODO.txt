- [ ] Configuration Over Hardcoding: The WarningCollector has a hardcoded filter for
      pydantic UserWarnings. In a real-world scenario, users would want to configure
      this.
       * Suggestion: Consider allowing users to configure warning filters through
         command-line arguments (e.g., --warn-error "pydantic.*") or a configuration
         section in pyproject.toml.
